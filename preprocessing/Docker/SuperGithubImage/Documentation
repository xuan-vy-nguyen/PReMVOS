How to use:
    Firstly, to install Docker on your computer, run install.sh
    Secondly, to build image, run build.sh
    Thirdly, to run container, run run.sh

How to config:
    command: 
        FROM <>   
                use default images which downloads on dockerhub.com
        RUN  <>   
                write terminal command in <> and use it to cd, cp, ... or install packages you need.
        ENV  <PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin:$PATH>
                set enviroment variables, all things in <...> is an examples
        ADD <A> <B>
                copy all things in folder <A> (in PC, should set absolute path to a folders) 
                to folder <B> (in docker)
        CMD [<python>,<A.py>,<...>]
                when you run container, those files will exec first.
        If you want to use some thing rooting system, you need put them before I created a non-root user and switch to it

Something when INSTALL new packages
        Sometime, we cannot run 'RUN apt-get update' or 'RUN apt-get install' , just run 'RUN apt-get update && apt-get install'
        Because we can not 'yes' when sofware ask for agreemention, so we need 'RUN apt-get install -y <packages>'

To connect inside docker
        Instead the container is running, you cannot access to container 
        docker ps       
                List all containers is running
        docker ps -a
                List all dockers evenwhen those stop
        docker exec <name>
